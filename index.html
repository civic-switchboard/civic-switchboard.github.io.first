        <p>
            <span class="lead-in">Civic Switchboard</span> is an <a href="https://www.imls.gov">Institute of Museum
            and Library Services</a> supported
            effort that aims to develop the capacity of academic and public libraries in civic data ecosystems.

        <p>
            This project encourages partnerships between libraries and local data intermediaries; these partnerships
            will better serve data users, further democratize data, and support equitable access to information. The
            project will create a toolkit for libraries interested in expanding (or beginning) their role around
            civic information.
        </p>

        <p>
            In Year 1, to broaden networks and expand resources, the project team will host workshops at two
            conferences: The <a href="https://www.neighborhoodindicators.org">National Neighborhood Indicators
            Partnership</a> (May 2018) and the <a href="https://www.diglib.org">Digital Library
            Federation</a> (October 2018). Stipends will be available for libraries and data intermediary
            organizations interested in participating in these workshops; a limited number of complimentary
            registration fees for the associated conferences will also be available.
        </p>

        <p>
            In Year 2, the project will offer stipends to partnerships between libraries and local data
            intermediaries for field testing the toolkit.
        </p>
