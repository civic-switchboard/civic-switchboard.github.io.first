        Subscribers can ask questions, carry on discussions, and post materials from other sources they think would be of interest to the group. The list is public and not moderated, but admins reserve the right to delete messages that are markedly off-subject or inappropriate (advertisements, solicitations, partisan political tracts, etc.)  Subscribers are responsible for obtaining permission ahead of time before they post anything that is not clearly in the public domain.
