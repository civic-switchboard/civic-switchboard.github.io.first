        <p>

            <b>The Civic Data Operators group allows those working to connect libraries with civic data in their local communities to exchange information and ideas and resources.</b>

        <p>
        Subscribers can ask questions, carry on discussions, and post materials from other sources they think would be of interest to the group. The list is public and not moderated, but admins reserve the right to delete messages that are markedly off-subject or inappropriate (advertisements, solicitations, partisan political tracts, etc.)  Subscribers are responsible for obtaining permission ahead of time before they post anything that is not clearly in the public domain.

       - Using the new Google Groups interface, you can change your settings (nickname display, how often you want to receive emails, unsubscribe, get email alerts of messages containing specific keywords, etc.) through clicking on the “My membership” link in the blue bar at the top of the page.  In the older interface, choose “Edit my membership” from the right-hand menu.

       - Please BE NOTE TO WHOM YOU ARE REPLYING when you respond to a message posted on the list.  If you just hit the "Reply" button, you will send a message back to the entire list.  If you want to respond to just the author of the original message, please choose "reply to author" instead.
