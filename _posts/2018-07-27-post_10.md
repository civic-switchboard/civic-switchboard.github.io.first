#### We are excited to announce the teams that will be participating in our [Las Vegas Workshop](https://civic-switchboard.github.io/updates/post_7)!
  
This workshop will bring together eleven egional teams of two to catalyze partnerships of libraries and civic data intermediaries, with each team including one library partner and one non-library civic data intermediary. Teams will learn to incubate new local data partnerships, get a better handle on their own civic data ecosystems, and learn from innovative peers across the country.
