Civic Switchboard is an [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/) supported effort that aims to develop the capacity of academic and public libraries in civic data ecosystems. Learn more about the project at our [website](https://civic-switchboard.github.io/).   


### [**We are happy to announce that we are now accepting submissions for our first workshop.**](https://goo.gl/forms/SxjfR1Y8PI6fZgX42)  

This workshop will take place before the [National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership (NNIP)](https://www.neighborhoodindicators.org/) meeting, on May 8th in Atlanta, GA.  We'll offer a similar version of this workshop in October 2018 before the [Digital Library Federation (DLF)](https://www.diglib.org/) conference in Las Vegas, NV; that workshop will have a separate application announcement and process.


This workshop will bring together ten regional teams to explore the potential for partnerships of libraries and civic data intermediaries. Teams will learn to incubate new local data partnerships, get a better handle on your own civic data ecosystem, and learn from innovative peers across the country. 
We are also offering a limited number of complimentary conference registrations for the library partner on the team to stay on for the NNIP conference and act as a cross-pollinator.


### [More information about eligibility and submission guidelines can be found in our application](https://goo.gl/forms/SxjfR1Y8PI6fZgX42).
