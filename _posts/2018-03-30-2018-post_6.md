### We are excited to announce the teams that will be participating in our [Atlanta Workshop](https://civic-switchboard.github.io/updates/post_3)!

This workshop will bring together twelve regional teams of two to catalyze partnerships of libraries and civic data intermediaries, with each team including one library partner and one non-library civic data intermediary. Teams will learn to incubate new local data partnerships, get a better handle on their own civic data ecosystems, and learn from innovative peers across the country.   

**We'll offer a similar version of this workshop in October 2018 before the [Digital Library Federation (DLF)](https://www.diglib.org/) conference in Las Vegas, NV. Look for the call in early June!**  

Sign up for our [mailing list](https://civicswitchboard.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=530c4fdb234145e8e1e6b5307&id=3ae069cc9d), send us an [email](mailto:civic-switchboard@pitt.edu) or find us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/civicswitch) to stay up to date with Civic Switchboard goings on!
